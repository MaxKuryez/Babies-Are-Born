# Babies-Are-Born
My first Web Application project using Javascript
Here the map of Europe is presented and each country is colored depending on fertility rate(from the database), 
I didn't add all the countries yet, but you can check it on some of them.
Also after selecting your country you can check your chances of having a baby.
